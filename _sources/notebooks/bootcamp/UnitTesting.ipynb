    "Testing is the process of ensuring that our analysis and pipelines are actually working and giving us the right answers, as well as ensuring that changes or new features to a codebase don't break something that currently works. This is done using tools which run our code on known, canned problems and compare the outputs to what is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "While testing is an absolute essential for large or community-maintained projects, it is never too early to implement testing in your own research code. It will make your code more robust, and also encourage good programming practices. There is even a *mode* of coding known as *test-driven development*, in which one writes the tests *first*, with the expected behavior, and then writes the actual functions to match. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Test driven development isn't very applicable to most standard research code, but having tests can be very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several testing frameworks out there; I use `pytest` primarily, and will thus use that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, it is best to have a folder for testing separate from your installed code, but for now, we'll simply make a file called `test_code.py` in the same directory as the python scripts containing the functions or classes we want to test. "
