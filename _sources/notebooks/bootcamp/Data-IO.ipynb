    "# File Input and Output (I/O)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll discuss several of the common methods for getting the types of dataset used by astronomers into Python for analysis, and how to save our own generated (or modified) data back out. This is a core skill, because it is usually the first step in any research endeavour that is not a pure theory-based analytic calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example: let's say you've found a research mentor --- graduate student, postdoc, or faculty --- and they have agreed to help you get started with research. Generally, this will involve two things: \n",
    "- They will provide a (possibly overwhelming) list of papers and review articles for you to read, and \n",
    "- They will provide some data related to the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then they might say something like \"As you skim through these papers to get a feel for what you will be doing, try playing around with these data a bit and see if you can make a plot of X vs Y.\" Or, they might say \"Go online and download the Nasa Sloan Atlas and see if you can make a BPT diagram for all the galaxies with non-zero line flux.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where file I/O comes in. Even if you have taken a general introductory Python course online or even in the computer science department of a university, those courses will likely never have had cause to teach you how to read in a `FITS` file, a specialized filetype which can only be interacted with via special tools. Even if your mentor provides something as simple as a text file with some columns of numbers written out (known as `ASCII`), it is likely that a function you may have learned such as \\code{numpy.loadtxt()} or \\code{pandas.read_csv()} won't work on that data right \"out of the box\" because astronomical data in ASCII files often \n",
    "\n",
    "- has missing entries\n",
    "- have a mix of delimeters \n",
    "- are not even formatted into clean columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "If that sounds frustrating, it is --- and it's why more constrained data formats (like `FITS`, `asdf`, or `hdf5`) are now preffered. Generally, if you can successfully *write* one of these files, adhering to their internal rules, you can *read* them back in simply and without hassle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following examples, I am going to demonstrate the *general* method for reading several common data formats in astronomy. This can be treated as a \"cheat-sheet\" in the data formats if you already know a bit of Python. If you are brand new to Python, I suggest skipping ahead to basic Python syntax and structure first, so that you can separate what is a Python-ism and what is data format related. \n",
    "\n",
    "## ASCII (text files)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest (in some sense) format for data storage is the humble text file. The primary advantage of an ASCII file as a data storage format is portability; no special software is needed to read these files (in fact, any computer can do so via one of several programs, including the shell). On many computers, you can preview the contents of a text file without even opening it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text files are also very flexible insofar is they impose no rules on how you format the information placed into a text file. As mentioned above, however, this can lead to headaches later, because decisions that make a text file read-friendly to the eye might make it impossible to parse (easily) via computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "ASCII files are so basic that even Python itself has an I/O operation that can read them in. Here is an example of that for one of the data sets you will use in the Chapter Assignment on astronomical imaging (*Note, this is almost never the recommended method*):"

    "\n",
    "Internally, a `FITS` file is organized into *extensions*. You can think of these as different containers in which different things can be stored. Many fits files only use one extension (say, to store a single image). But a `FITS` file containing a whole survey catalog may utilize multiple extensions to store different tables, such as one for each field of the survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we read a `FITS` file into an object, it is iterable (or list-like), meaning we access the different extensions by indexing (above I only use the 0th index for the first extension). Each extension (container) has two attributes: data, and a header. The data is, as it sounds, whatever data we have stored. Generally, it is either image-like (as in, an array of numbers) or tabular (there is a specific internal formatting to handle column names, data types, etc). The header, meanwhile, can be thought of as the metadata --- it usually contains information about whatever is stored in the data attribute (sometimes critical information for parsing that data). For example, image data usually have headers with information like the exposure time, telescope name, RA and DEC where the telescope was pointing, what filter was used, etc. For our Python purposes, a header gets read into the dictionary format, with keys and values. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why I chose the name `hdu` when reading in the file. As each extension contains a header and some data, the standard name for one is \"header data unit,\" or hdu. Above, we could've used any name. But knowing what HDU means is useful because if we were to *write* a `FITS` file, we'd need to do something like the following:"

And if we need multiple extensions, we would create a `fits.HDUList()`, containing a `fits.PrimaryHDU()` and possibly some additional `fits.ImageHDU()`'s. \n",
    "\n",
    "For non-tabular `FITS` files, the `image` variable above will just be a `numpy` array, and the `header` will just be a dictionary. For a much deeper dive into what to do from here if working with an image, see the workbook on Astronomical Imaging.\n",
